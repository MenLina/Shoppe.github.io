<p class="ring">What ring to propose to a girl with and what is the difference between wedding, engagement and engagement rings?
    In Russia, the engagement tradition has not gained popularity, as in other countries. But the very ring with which they usually make an offer is still called the engagement ring. We know from our own experience with what trepidation men approach the choice of this ring and how much emotion they put into it. When choosing a ring, you should pay attention to the following things:
</p>
    <ol class="rules">
        <li>Surely, you are well aware of the aesthetic preferences of your other half and you know what she will like. Pay attention to what metal she most often wears jewelry. Someone fundamentally likes only silver, someone wears only gold. Try to remember if your half is allergic to some types of metals.

        </li>
        <li>Find out your ring size. If your spouse has rings that she wears, then you are in luck. Discreetly measure the inner diameter of the ring with a ruler in millimeters - this is the size. If there are no rings, then we connect the fantasy. For this, my friends and I played out a whole scene, forcing the future bride to try on a ring with which we determined her size. In the company, a friend drew attention to my ring, asked him to take it off in order to take a closer look and tried it on. Further, discussing its design, we began to try on the ring in a circle, until it was the turn of a friend whose size we needed to determine. We were lucky, it turned out to be the right size, and the secret remained intact. You can involve the closest bridesmaids in finding out the size, for sure, they will be able to help you with this issue with cunning tricks. Of course, only if you are sure that they will not spoil your surprise.

        </li>
        <li>The easiest option to get a medium size ring is 16.5. It will most likely fit on one of the fingers. If you purchase a ring from us and you do not have the opportunity to know the exact size, then we will replace it for free with the right one if the ring does not fit.

        </li>
    </ol>

    <p class="conclusion">Do not forget that engagement rings should be comfortable for everyday wear. Therefore, do not try to surprise with the size of the stone if your lady does not wear massive jewelry in everyday life. Often, after the wedding, the engagement ring is not removed, but continues to be worn along with the wedding ring. If in the future you decide to purchase wedding rings from us, you can be sure that they will harmoniously combine with each other.</p>
